The Scripts in this folder were strictly used to generate stored procedures, as well as a data access layer based on ssms database.
Under no circumstances should these scripts be run, since they were already used and will cause fatal problems when running them again.

Order the scripts were run in:
 -SCRIPT 1: which produce SCRIPT 2
 -SCRIPT 2: Which were produced by SCRIPT 1
 -SCRIPT 3: which produce c# code which are copied into the source code under the folder DAT, into a class file DataAccess.cs 

After the above scripts was setup and completed, update the LTSGenerator file according to your local database settings:
example:
values needed:
server= M-PC
database= ssms
namespace= ssms.LTS
user= sa
password= root
code= C:\ssms\ssms\LTS\LTSBase.cs

together the above values builds this string:
sqlmetal /server:M-PC /database:ssms  /namespace:ssms.LTS /user:sa /password:root /code:"C:\ssms\ssms\LTS\LTSBase.cs" /views /functions /sprocs /language:c# /context:LTSBase

After the above was completed, the LTSGenerator file was ran which brings the application and database together by updating the LTS files.
